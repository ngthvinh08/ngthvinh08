### 👋 Hi, I’m Vinh

🎓 I’m an Electronics Engineering student with strong interest in **embedded systems**, **IoT**, and **PCB design**.  
💡 I enjoy building smart devices that bridge the gap between hardware and software.

---

### 👀 I’m interested in:
- Embedded programming (C, STM32, ESP32, Arduino)
- IoT systems and sensor integration
- PCB design (Altium Designer, KiCad)
- Machine learning applications on edge devices (TinyML)

---

### 🌱 I’m currently learning:
- Real-time systems with **FreeRTOS**
- Multi-layer PCB layout and signal integrity
- Communication protocols (SPI, I2C, UART, MQTT)
- Low-power design for IoT

---

### 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on:
- Open-source IoT or embedded firmware projects
- PCB design and prototyping
- Projects that combine AI + embedded systems (e.g., edge ML)
